## Running the Java Project

I used the Swing library to build this Game of Life simulation. If you want to clone this repo with the Java project, you have to type:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Mateusz-best-creator/Game_Of_Life_Java.git
```

Once you've cloned the project, you can open your IDE and start the game! Messages about what is going on are displayed in the console. You can click on an empty cell and then decide by typing the appropriate character in the console what kind of organism you want to add. At the beginning you have to type board height and width, then at the start of the turn, you can:

- Press `p` to play
- Press `q` to quit
- Press `s` to save the state of the game to a file
- Press `r` to read the state of the game from a file

Once you've clicked `p`, you can use the arrow keys to move the human if they are alive or press `s` to activate the human's special ability, which temporarily increases their strength.
